## 📌 Overview

LeadTap turns **handshakes into booked calls in 7 days** — bridging real-world interactions (networking events, trade shows, referrals) into automated follow-up sequences that actually convert.

We’re combining:
- n8n for backend automation
- LLM agents for intelligent engagement
- CRM and calendar integrations
- Event-to-call funnel logic
