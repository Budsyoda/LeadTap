# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe youâ€™ve found a security vulnerability in LeadTap, we want to hear from you. Please do **not** publicly disclose the issue.

Instead, report it directly to:

ðŸ“§ **mdavis@bigado.com**

We will respond as quickly as possible and take immediate steps to investigate, mitigate, and patch the vulnerability.

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest `main` branch. If you're running a fork or older version, we may not be able to offer support or fixes.

## Disclosure Policy

Once a vulnerability is resolved, we may publicly acknowledge the report (with permission), and document the fix as part of our changelog and commit history.
