# 🔐 NDA Request: Access to LeadTap Private Materials

Thanks for your interest in LeadTap — a high-leverage AI-first platform focused on automating client acquisition for professionals in legal, medical, and other compliance-heavy industries.

We're looking for **serious collaborators**, not just volunteers.

## 💰 About Compensation

Let’s be real: **you should get paid.**  
And if we do this right, you will — in a way that could be *far* more substantial than a standard contract gig.

That said, this is a **bootstrap-stage build** — capital is inbound but not yet deployed.  
We're inviting select partners to contribute now, with the clear understanding that:

- **Upfront cash is limited**
- **Back-end rewards are intended to be substantial**
- **Equity, advisor shares, rev-share, and future salaries** are all on the table

If you're in this to build something meaningful and win together, we’re aligned.

Let’s build something foundational — and make sure the people who build it **own it**.
